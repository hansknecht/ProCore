# What is required to deliver a product successfully?

*Getting the right work done at the right time*
## This does not include:
- A specific toolset
- A specific methodology
- A specific set of deliverables
- A specific governance approach
- A specific set or combination of stakeholders

## Assumptions to avoid: 
- Any approach will work
- A single approach will always work
- The "right work" implies "all work"
- The "right work" implies "perfect work"
- The "right work" is specific to the requested deliverables
- The "right time" is specific to the needs of the end user

## This requires:
- Defining the frame of reference for the objectives at hand
- Evaluating the full scope of work to accomplish, including:
	- Education
	- Supporting team members
	- Including discovery, hand-off, and transition time
	- Providing a sufficient accounting for and defense of the work being accomplished
	- Sufficiently justifying the value the team brings to the table
- Tackling uncomfortable and difficult tasks
- Tackling turd tasks
- Not avoiding tasks because they solving complex, ambigious, or difficult problems
- Securing the right number of appropriately trained and skilled resources
	- Identifying the right number of resources
	- Identifying the appropriateness of teh skill level of the resources
	- Acquiring the right number of appropriately trained and skilled resources

## Signs you are not getting the right work done at the right time
- Reacting rather than Planning
- Stakeholders are unable to state their delivery expectation 
- People are working overtime
- Missing commitments
- Not making time dependent commitments
- Absence of a verifiable delivery plan
- Unable to demonstrate  a functional product
- Lack of a post delivery support plan
- Taking action to manage perceptions outside of defining, delivering and demonstrating completion of the product plan
- Accepting work without verifying accountability on all necessary tasks in the plan
