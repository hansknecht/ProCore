# What is required to deliver a product successfully?

## This does not include:
- Utilizing a specific toolset
- Utilizing a specific methodology
- Utilizing a specific set of deliverables
- Utilizing a specific governanace approach
- Utilizing a specific set or combination of stakeholders

## This is not to be confused with: 
- Suggesting that any approach will work
- Suggesting that a single approach will always work
- Suggesting that the "right work" implies "all work"
- Suggesting that the "right work" implies "perfect work"
- Suggesting that the "right work" implies anything to do with the deliverables specifically being requested
- Suggesting that the "right time" only account the considerations and needs of the end user

## This requires:
- Defining the appropriate frame of reference for the objectives at hand
- Evaluating the full scope of work necessary to accomplish, including:
	- Education
	- Supporting team members
	- Including discovery, hand-off, and transition time
	- Providing a sufficient accounting for and defense of the work being accomplished
	- Sufficiently justifying the value the team brings to the table
- Tackling turd tasks
- Not halting (or outright dismissing) tasks that require solving complex problems
- Having the right number of appropriately trained and skilled resources
	- Identifying the right number of resources
	- Identifying the appropriateness of teh skill level of the resources
	- Acquiring the right number of appropriately trained and skilled resources

## Signes you are not getting the right work dones at the right time
- Fires constantly need to be put out
- Management/stakeholders is unclear on what work is being delivered
- People are working overtime
- Promissing the work will get / be done by a certain time and the work not being done by that time
- Having a definition of done that doesn't adequately account for sufficient levels of discovery, testing, hand-off / transition / coordination with team members, PRs, reasonable expecations of defect fix requireed post-testing, and deployment time
- You intentionally "under-promise and over-deliver"
- You position that the reason work is not being delivered is because other people are doing their job adequetely, therby impeding your ability to deliver
