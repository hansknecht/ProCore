# ProCore
It was suggested furry-enigma, but that didn't seem the best choice

# Mission Statement
Coordinate lessons learned across organizations to develope a set of guides. These guides serve as foundationsl documents for team development. 

# Assumptions
- What works well for one group is not universally benefictial for all groups.
	- We will search for the why
- Documenting the path to reach a process is as important as the final process
	- If a foundational event or circumstance changes the process may need to change as well
- The why is critical for all development
	- curiosity and learning is an accptable why ... unless others are paying you
- Documentaiton written in MarkDown
	- https://www.markdownguide.org/
	- Allows conversion to other formats if it is decided to publish
